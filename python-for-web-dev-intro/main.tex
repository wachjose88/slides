\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Python is an interpreted, multi-paradigm programming language
      with an extensive standard library and a huge repository for 
      third-party libraries
    \item Flask is a microframework for web development with extensions
      for many web-related functionalities
    \item in contrast Django is a complex framework including a wide range
      of these functionalities
